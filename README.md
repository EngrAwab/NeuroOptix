# Neuro Optix Project Documentation

## Introduction
Neuro Optix is an innovative project that revolutionizes robotic surveillance and safety systems through advanced automation and artificial intelligence. Built with durable 3D-printed parts and acrylic sheets, the robotic car features DC motor-powered wheels for seamless movement across various terrains. At its core is the OAK-D AI camera, mounted atop the car to monitor distances between personnel and machinery, enhancing safety in environments like construction sites.

## Problem Statement
Managing worker safety on construction sites presents several logistical and financial challenges:
- Handling transportation costs.
- Ensuring timely payment of monthly salaries.
- Addressing persistent issues related to corruption and negligence that undermine safety enforcement.

These challenges necessitate a robust and efficient monitoring system to ensure the safety and well-being of workers.

## Proposed Solutions
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-faceted approach:
- **Stationary Cameras:** Installed around the site for continuous surveillance and monitoring worker activities.
- **Safety Helmet Cameras:** Provide a first-person perspective to ensure real-time monitoring of individual workers' safety and compliance with safety protocols.
- **Robots:** Equipped with advanced computer vision technology to autonomously navigate the site, detect potential hazards, and provide dynamic surveillance.

## Objectives
- **Enhance Workplace Safety:** Advanced surveillance to reduce risks.
- **Improve Operational Efficiency:** Streamline safety monitoring processes.
- **Global Remote Control:** Enable remote operation from anywhere in the world.
- **Versatile Deployment:** Adapt the system for various industrial environments.

## KRIA Setup
### Step 1: Access the Official Documentation
Visit the Kria KR260 official documentation to familiarize yourself with the setup process and requirements.

### Step 2: Update the Firmware
Run the following commands to update the firmware:
```
wget --no-check-certificate 'https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1wACTcpbwLPOH9UUuURk5qcnIYeEverSB' -O k26_update3.BIN
sudo xmutil bootfw_update -i <path-to-FW.BIN file>
sudo xmutil bootfw_status
sudo shutdown -r now
sudo xmutil bootfw_update -v
```
Replace `<path-to-FW.BIN file>` with the actual path.

### Step 3: Set Up Wi-Fi

### Helmet Detection
The system accurately detects whether workers are wearing helmets in real-time, ensuring compliance with safety regulations. Unfortunately we were unable to visit the safety site so we conducted this expereiment at video taken from interenet.
